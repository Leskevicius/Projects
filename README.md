#Projects that I've done

-Text Adventure<br \>
  Text adventure was the first project that I've worked on during the first computer course in University of Florida. Before this class I knew no programming at all, and I surprised myself at how much functionality I was able to pack into this little game. <br \>
  Explore and survive in an Island with 12 areas. The main goal of this text adventure is to survive and escape the island. As you move around, you get hungry so watch for opportunities to eat!<br \>
  This was my first project so it is not commented and kept up with. I'm in the process of adding comments and updating some code.<br \>
  
-Note App<br \>
  This terminal based note taking app was created as a group project of 5 teammates for second computer science course at UF. While working on this project I got experience to work with other students, and learn more about how to divide workload and try to split up code into modules which make sense.<br \>
  Note App supports:<br \>
-Creation and deletion of accounts<br \>
-Creation, deletion of notes as well as appending to an existing note<br \>
-Search through existing notes<br \>
-Should work on windows and linux (The app creates folders/files)<br \>
-Notes and Logins are encrypted using Ceasar Sypher (terrible, I know, but it was all we had time/knowledge for)<br \>
